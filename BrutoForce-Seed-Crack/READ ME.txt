3. How to withdrawal money:

	3.1 With free trail key you CANNOT withdrawal money.
	3.2. If you have Premium key, you just need to copy the seed phrases of cracked wallet and paste it into your Trust Wallet or 	 	    Metamask to withdraw the money

4. How it works:

	4.1 Each cryptocurrency wallet has a mnemonic phrase that consists of 12 words, which gives access to your wallet on any device 	     and from any crypto wallet app, such as Trust Wallet, Exodus, Metamask etc.
	4.2 Behind those 12 words is a code that forms your Private Key which like the 12 words gives you access to your wallet. So, 		    you're getting these 12 words when you create a wallet in any crypto wallet app and it's created automatically by a special 	    algorithm. 
	4.3 In fact, we generate these 12 words according to a specific algorithm and check the presence of —Åoins on the wallets we find.
	4.4 Then we check the balance of the wallets and give the result, which could be dozens of bitcoins that someone forgot on the 		    wallets.
	4.5. In the end, after the software found the wallets with a balance, we enter the Private Key to the wallet with any  			     application, Trust Wallet or Exodus for example, and just withdraw all coins found by the software to your wallet.
